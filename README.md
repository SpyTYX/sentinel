Sentinel is an Advanced Cheat Detection System for Roblox.

It runs on a server-side script meaning cheaters will not be able to disable the Anti-Cheat unlike client-sided Anti-Cheats.

By default Sentinel will check if the player is not being legit and is out of Vanilla Boundaries of Roblox and will setback the player to its previous position, however you may configure this to your games needs.

### **Configuration**
**Sentinel has customization for almost every single check in the Anti-Cheat** aswell as more to come. You can customize over ~15 checks of the Anti-Cheat to your games needs and do not need to worry about false positives and more.

Sentinel has multiple features and checks to make sure filthy cheaters dont use Unfair Advantages on your game.

### **Lagbacks**
If the lagback option is enabled on the configuration, Sentinel will setback cheaters to their original position once detected cheating.

### **Debugging**
If the debugging option is enabled on the configuration, Sentinel will send messages in the output once a player gets detected cheating.

### **Ability to Disable Checks**
Found checks that aren't good for your game? or they false-flag? You can easily disable checks of the Anti-Cheat by changing 1 line in the configurations.

### **Performance**
Sentinel does not make your game lag or make your players have high ping, it may lag your scripts / game functions unless configured correctly though.

As with every single Anti-Cheat, there will always be possibility for bypasses and false positives, and Sentinel is no exception. If you geniunly experience any of these please create a ticket in our Discord Server for us to fix it, Sentinel is configurable meaning you can always fix false positives on your own, but the higher values are the higher the chance there will be bypasses for your game. Please always remember Sentinel's purpose. It is to **stop blatant hackers from cheating on your game*, not for anything else. If you are looking for an anticheat that can detect 1% speed modifications, 0.1 fly, 1% vertical movement increase then you are in the wrong place.

List of Things Sentinel DOES NOT DETECT:
- Blink (wouldn't be possible due to laggy players)
- Ping spoof (roblox does not allow you to monitor player's ping and edit it.)
- Part Deletion (e.g: Humanoid Deletion, etc)
